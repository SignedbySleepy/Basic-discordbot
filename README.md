# Basic-discordbot
This bot has basic commands for moderating members, it has kick,ban,unban(does not work), and clean/purge. It will grant users a role of your choice upon joining your server and has a custom activity status. This code is open source and is my first python project feel free to tweak is as much as you want and send them to me or put them on this git for me to see. Enjoy
